Slimstart
================================

Slimstart is a setup for getting up to speed with your PHP web quickly. It is based on:

- Slim Framework (Sinatra-like lightweight PHP framework)
- Mustache (Logicless templating for PHP and JS)
- Layout based on HTML5 Boilerplate
- SASS
- Modernizr
- jQuery
- CSS Reset
- Mustache.js [https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/]

Sass: (Need to have SASS installed, [http://sass-lang.com])
sass --watch www/scss:www/css --style expanded

Everything should work from start (if you are using nginx you have to modify the nginx.conf file according to your local setup), go to 

http://slimstart.dev/hello/

and you should see "Hello world"

Go to

http://slimstart.dev/hello/ridgestreet

and you should see "Hello ridgestreet"
