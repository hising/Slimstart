Slimstart
================================

Slimstart is a setup for getting up to speed with your PHP web quickly. It is based on:

- Slim Framework (Sinatra-like lightweight PHP framework)
- Mustache (Logicless templating for PHP and JS)
- Layout based on HTML5 Boilerplate
- Compass + SASS
- Twitter Bootstrap (Sass-version https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap)
- CoffeeScript
- Modernizr
- jQuery
- CSS Reset
- Mustache.js [https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/]

Sass: (Need to have SASS and Compass installed, [http://sass-lang.com])
$ gem update --system
$ gem install compass

CoffeeScript (Need Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm) http://npmjs.org/)
$ npm install -g coffee-script

Run environment (Requires tmux - http://tmux.sourceforge.net/ )
$ cd {project_home}
$ ./ridge start

Everything should work from start (if you are using nginx you have to modify the nginx.conf file according to your local setup), go to 

http://slimstart.dev/hello/

and you should see "Hello world"

Go to

http://slimstart.dev/hello/ridgestreet

and you should see "Hello ridgestreet"
